## Timbre Classification Experiments
This repository contains datasets and scripts for timbre classification experiments conducted as part of my Ph.D. thesis. Two datasets were used. The first one concentrates on drum/percussion sounds while the other generalises to orchestral sounds. See the relevant iPython notebooks to re-run experiments.

The orchestral sample is quite large, there is a script that pulls N number samples randomly in the folder, for performing smaller analyses.
